Version Control Project Reflection

In this project, I practiced using Git and GitHub to understand how version control works in a real-world setting. I created a repository, worked with branches, merged changes, resolved conflicts, and used pull requests to simulate team collaboration.

One of the main challenges was handling merge conflicts, but working through them helped me better understand how Git tracks changes and manages code differences. I also reviewed a peer’s pull request, which showed me the importance of checking code before merging and collaborating effectively with others.

Overall, this project helped me feel more confident using GitHub and version control tools, and it gave me a better understanding of how developers work together on shared codebases.
